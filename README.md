### pirata
What this is? This project parses local cinema site and sends email to all subscribers about new upcoming films.
It is a pet-project of mine.   
This is a sandbox, a playground if you will, where I try and poke things I'm interested in.    
It is funny how it used to be just a single python script in the beginning and now it is a little bit more than that.
